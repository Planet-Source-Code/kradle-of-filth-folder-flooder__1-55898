## Folder Flooder

### Description

REWRITTEN DESCRIPTION: For educational purposes only. This program I've written is like a virus, but it does no damage to the files, boot sectors, or the hard drive, etc., hense it's safe. There is no form in this project since it wasn't needed. So Sub Main() in the module will automatically be called. People in PSC is calling this program a "waste" when it is not. You can learn a lot from it. Like basic VBScripting, error handling, reading and writing to the registry, finding out what drives exist on the computer, recursing all directories in an array, hiding directories/files, etc. I have no intention of creating havok and destroying files, operating systems, etc. I just wanted viral like code, only it simply folder floods. And folders do no damage what so ever. The only thing annoying about it is deleting them by hand. I'm going to tone down the code a little bit to make it cleaner to use in this site. And please, don't flame me anymore. I uploaded this program for others to learn from it, not to get chewed out.
